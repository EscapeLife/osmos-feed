        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[程序员们也许是互联网上最爱分享的群体之一，他们不仅喜欢开源自己写的软件，也爱通过写文章来分享知识。从业以来，我阅读过大量技术文章，其中不乏一些佳作。这些佳作中，有些凭借深刻的技术洞见令我深受启发，也有些以庖丁解牛般的精湛手法解释一项技术，让我读后大呼过瘾。
作为“爱分享”的程序员中的一份子，我想当一次推荐人，将读过的好文章分享给大家。我给这个系列起名为《程序员阅读清单：我喜欢的 100 篇技术文章》。
受限于本人的专业与兴趣所在，清单中的文章对以下几个领域有所偏重：程序员通识、软件工程、后端开发、技术写作、Python 语言、Go 语言。
下面是阅读清单的第一部分，包含第 1 到 20 篇文章。
清单
1. 《开发者应学习的 10 件有关“学习”的事》
原文链接：10 Things Software Developers Should Learn about Learning
作者：Neil C.C. Brown, Felienne F. J. Hermans, and Lauren E. Margulieux
学习对于任何一个人都很重要，对于软件开发者来说更是如此。这是一篇有关“学习”的科普类文章，从介绍人类记忆的工作原理开始，引出专家与新手的区别、间隔与重复的重要性等主题。
文章中的一些观点相当具有启发性。比如“抽象和具象”：新知识对于初学者来说先是抽象的，然后通过大量例子将其具象化，最终彻底掌握后又重新变回抽象。又比如：做智力题和编程能力并没有关联性——这和我们认知中的“聪明人更会编程”大不相同。
2. 《开发者如何管理自驱力》
原文链接：Managing My Motivation, as a Solo Dev
作者：Marcus Buffett
作者是一名单兵作战的开发者，分享在管理自驱力方面的心得。文章提供了许多提高自驱力的切实可行的小点子，比如：
